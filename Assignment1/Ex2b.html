                    <p>The food was excellent. It came out very fast and the service was great. My only complaint is that I couldn't try every meal. The staff went out of their way to make our visit memorable, we were seated on time and staff went out of their way to ensure the experience level was superb. We truly appreciated the excellent food and top notch service provided by the entire team from the time I made the reservation to my check-in at the hostess desk and our departure. My compliments to the chef and kitchen as the the preparation and presentation food was amazing and the service was beyond compare.</p>

                    <p>Who put this quaint authentic Italian pizzeria in the middle of bustling NYC? 10/10 would recommend. Our order was taken immediately. We ordered the fall pumpkin seed salad and a large pie. The Trenton tomato pie is definitely not the same as Consohocken tomato pie but is very good. Thin crust, heavy sauce and light cheese. We did not get the citrus dressing on our salad. Good call because the apples tasted like they had been soaked in it and they were bitter. The fresh mozzarella in the salad, so good! Melted in your mouth! I should have gotten that on my pizza!</p>
